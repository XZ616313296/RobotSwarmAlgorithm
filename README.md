# RobotSwarmAlgorithm
Designed a control algorithm for a group of autonomous robots explicating flocking behaviour. Compared to other flocking behaviours the designed algorithm helped robots -Move in the same direction -Remain close to the neighbours while avoiding collision  -Minimize drag by reducing the frontal area using an artificial potential function.
